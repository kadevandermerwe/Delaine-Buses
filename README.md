# Delaine-Buses
The goal of this project is to improve the customer experience of the DelaineBuses website by changing the way users plan out their journeys.

Before this project, users had to sift through multiple PDF timetable files with an overwhelming amount of data to plan out their journeys.

What this project will accomplish:

1. A feature that allows users to input their destination, their current location, their time of departure and preferred time of arrival which will then output the specific bus route number, stop, departure and arrival times and any changes that are necessary along the way.
2. Improve the UI/UX of the site
